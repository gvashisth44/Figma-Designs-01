# Figma-Designs-01
Created some templates in Figma for Web developers during an internship at Care Health Insurance Ltd. While the designs are low fidelity, I am aiming to improve on them hereafter.
The project was the "E-mail Popup" project which included creating a Figma based UI template to created a popup within the landing page of the company's website.
The popup would help them to a e-mail window which would help the customer to send an e-mail to the Customer First E-mail Address of the company identical to the G-mail Draft window popup.
